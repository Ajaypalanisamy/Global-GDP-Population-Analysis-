# 🌍 Global Population & GDP Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes **global population**, **GDP**, **literacy rates**, and **health indicators** from 1960–2017 using **Excel, SQL, and Power BI**.  
It integrates multiple datasets, cleans and transforms them, and builds **interactive dashboards** to visualize economic and demographic trends worldwide.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Clean, merge, and transform multi-source datasets.
- Perform **descriptive statistical analysis**.
- Create **DAX measures** for growth calculations and per capita values.
- Build interactive Power BI dashboards for insights.
- Identify **key correlations** (e.g., Literacy Rate vs GDP Growth).

---

## 📂 Datasets Used
1. **Countries of World** – demographic, economic, and health indicators.  
2. **Population per Country** – yearly population data from 1960–2017.  
3. **GDP by Country** – yearly GDP data from 1960–2016.  
4. **MetaData Country** – region and income group classification.  

---

## 🛠️ Data Cleaning & Transformation
- Removed duplicates and irrelevant rows.
- Handled missing values using **regional averages**.
- Standardized country names.
- Converted data types for calculations.
- **Unpivoted year columns** for time-series analysis.
- Created DAX measures for:
  - GDP Growth Rate (%)
  - Population Growth Rate (%)
  - GDP per Capita
  - Literacy & Infant Mortality averages
  - Population Categories

---

## 📊 Statistical Analysis
- Identified **highest & lowest GDP per capita** countries.
- Computed **regional literacy rate averages**.
- Studied long-term GDP & population growth trends.
- Compared health outcomes by income group.

---

## 📈 Dashboards
### **Dashboard 1**
